# How to contribute

Thanks for your time and willingness to contribute! This page gives a few guidelines:

## Reporting issues

If you have found a bug in the software (or any other erroneous behaviour) please file a bug report.
Bugs are tracked on our GitHub [issue](https://github.com/computationalgeography/agent_based_exposure_assessment/issues) page.
To allow us to reproduce the issue please provide as much information as possible such that we can reproduce the bug:

- The Python version used.
- Details about the operating system used.
- The description of the problem in as much detail as possible.
- If possible, a minimal working example and zip or archive file with all data and scripts.

## Solving issues

If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a pull request with a fix.

## Pull requests

In case you can provide a code fix yourself or want to contribute additional functionality please consider submitting a [pull](https://github.com/computationalgeography/agent_based_exposure_assessment/pulls) request.

For something that is bigger than a trivial fix follow these steps:

1. Create an issue describing the changes you intend to make.
2. Create your own fork of the repository, or make sure it is in sync with the upstream project.
3. Create a branch with the corresponding issue number.
4. Switch to that branch.
5. Apply your modifications.
6. Ensure cross-platform compatibility; for Linux, Mac, and Windows. Preferably provide unit tests as well.

Enable the checkbox to allow maintainer edits so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a team member will review your proposal.
We may ask questions, request additional information or may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged.

All contributions to this project will be released under the MIT license.
By submitting a pull request:

- You state that the contribution was created in whole by you and you have the right to submit it.
