# Concepts

A person's exposure is computed by combining the whereabouts of a person with environmental factors.
For the description of locations in space we use the concept of spatial contexts,
for the description of time we use activities
to describe the space-time path of a person.

## Spatial context

The framework currently considers these different spatial contexts:

- point: a location given by a x,y coordinate

- buffer: an area, given by a centre location with x,y coordinate and a buffer size

- route: a track on the traffic network from a start point to end point using


## Activity

Activities describe the space-time environment of an agent, consisting of: a spatial context, the start time and the duration of an activity.

## Schedule

Activities of an agent e.g. during a day can be specified as a set of activities.
