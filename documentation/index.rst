A brief documentation of the framework for agent-based exposure assessment.

This project provides a computational framework to model population health and citizens' exposures to multiple environmental factors.
The framework provides allows to estimate personal exposures by providing building blocks combining spatio-temporal information on environmental factors with space-time paths of individual persons given by activity profiles.
Mobility of persons can be considered and is facilitated by routing over OpenStreetMap data.
